He leads the \"Label Free\" research group demolishing boundaries between physics, biology and materials science. From inexpensive photosynthetic solar panels to quantum effects in biomolecules, and from cytoskeletal memory encoding and machine olfaction to bioenergy harvesting, his research and the technologies it spawns are used by industry and government, exhibited at the Boston Museum of Science and Designer's Open Exhibition, awarded consumer product awards and regularly covered by global  media including CNN, BBC, NYT, Discovery Channel, Wired, New Scientist, Nature and Science.\nHaving won the TAMU Center for New Ventures Business Idea competition and advised several MIT100K teams, he co-founded the HBN Big Idea Competition for early stage startups, and is chief consultant at Rebel Minds  -specializing in rapid lab to market transition.\nHe is the co-founder and Director of the international non-profit Molecular Frontiers Inquiry Prize (MFIP) a.k.a \"Kid Nobel\" open to anyone under 18 years old (www.moleclues.org) awarded annually at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm (home of the science Nobels). Winners are determined by a jury of eminent scientists including thirteen Nobel laureates. The MFIP is the world's first ever prize awarded for asking good questions.\nHe earned his MSci in Physics at Imperial College London and received his MS and PhD in Physics from Texas A&M University. He is a Scuba divemaster, a private pilot and sometimes teaches the \"hard\" freshman physics class at MIT.\n\nAbout TEDx:\n\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",

It's not science fiction -- these are all possible applications of a material known as graphene.\n\nThis so-called \"wonder material\" is 100 times stronger than steel but thinner than any known solid. And It's the focus of the latest episode of ChemMatters.\n\nThe video explains how graphene's incredible properties come from the unique arrangement of its atoms.  Graphene, like diamonds and coal, is made up entirely of carbon. But unlike those materials, graphene's carbon atoms are arranged in two-dimensional sheets, making it incredibly strong and flexible. Since graphene also conducts electricity as well as copper, it could lead to flexible cell phone touchscreens and transparent, inexpensive solar cells. Ongoing advances in manufacturing graphene are bringing these and other devices closer to reality.\n\nAnimation and motion graphics by Sean Parsons\nDirected by Adam Dylewski\n\n[Correction: The video's narration incorrectly states that Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov are chemists.
